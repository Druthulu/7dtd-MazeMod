    Requirements: (Server&Client)
        CompoPack 48
            Recommended to install into \AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\LocalPrefabs\ for less lag

    Extract the 7z archive to your Desktop and Double Click the Batch file to install automatically
        Extracts into your \AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\ folder.
            The folder structure is:
                \GeneratedWorlds
                \LocalPrefabs
                \Mods

    Infomration:
        Why is this download so small? 
            Your game will build the world dtm.raw and processed files on first launch.

        How did you do this?

    Troubleshooting Steps:
        How do I extract a 7z?
            Install 7zip, its open source.
        Don't see the Map name when starting a new world?
            Use the Batch file to install
            Verfiy the folder scructure as outlined above

        Don't see the Prefabs in game?
            Install CompoPack 48 to your LocalPrefabs folder

        Red Errors in the Console?
            My Mod foldder starts with 6 Z's on purpose to allow all other mods to load before mine then overwrites thier changes.
            Depending on the errors it might be imporatant.
            Should work with many mods
            Report error messages and mod list for help troubleshooting

        Gameplay Information:
            There are a few ways you can play this. Difficulty 3 (0-5) is what I normally play on. 
            However you could play at a lower difficulty and do a permadeath run. That would be a fun idea to see how far you can get. Since this type of map is more for nomad lifestyle (not base building), it woudn't be a huge loss to have to start over each run.
            You still can build bases and do everything you can in a normal playthrough.
